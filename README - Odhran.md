# Gangplank

I had fun making this project and did it piece meal over Sunday.
Things have been hectic and thought this was the most enjoyable way to do it.

UI/UX wise I really wanted to try out a stripped down interface with a high colour contrast using black and white for the interface and all data being reflected by vibrant colours

- Use the 'View By Material' or 'View By Size' buttons to visualise all currently visible ramps, clicking on a segment of the relevant chart will then filter out all other data.
- Use the 'Filter Data' button to specify exactly which size or material you wish to view.
- Use the conditional button below to dismiss the filter. If a material is filtered then this button will be coloured accordingly.

## If I had more time
- Draggable windows for the filter and visualisation
- Some sort of map marker over the top of a ramp if zoomed out to a certain degree, maybe 2 half circles spinning counter clockwise
- More efficient filtering
- Better colour contrast
- Better loading animation
- Better favicon
- Find source of the component will mount errors, using functional components so assuming its part of a node module
